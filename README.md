Ouroboros is an open-source, general-purpose AI agent whose identity, durable memory, and history continue across tasks and restarts. It works on external projects, coordinates a live swarm of specialist agents, and can rewrite the implementation it runs on, including its code, architecture, prompts, tools, and dependencies. Reflection can also change how it understands itself without severing that continuity.

It runs as a native desktop app or through a headless CLI. The runtime keeps its repository, durable memory, history, and interface on your machine, while model inference can use remote APIs you configure or a local GGUF model.

> **Changing Ouroboros? Coding agents and people must read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before editing.** It defines the required project context, verification, and separate-agent review flow.

### Windows quick start

1. Click [**Download for Windows (.zip)**][download-windows-x64].
2. Extract the ZIP.
3. Open the extracted `Ouroboros` folder and run `Ouroboros.exe`.

### Linux quick start

- On Debian, Ubuntu, or Astra Linux, download the `.deb` above and run `sudo apt install ./ouroboros_*_amd64.deb`.
- On Fedora or RHEL, download the generic `.rpm` above and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.x86_64.rpm`. RED OS 8 has its own `red80` package.
- On another x86_64 distribution, download the AppImage, make it executable with `chmod +x Ouroboros-*.AppImage`, and run it. Git must already be installed.

To run tasks, configure at least one supported remote provider API key or a local GGUF model. The first-run wizard guides model access, review policy, and budget setup.

<details>
<summary>Optional CLI included with desktop downloads</summary>

The desktop packages already contain an optional CLI installer. On macOS, after copying the app to Applications, double-click `Install CLI.command` in the mounted DMG. On Linux use `./Ouroboros/bin/install-ouroboros-cli`; on Windows use `Ouroboros\bin\install-ouroboros-cli.cmd`. These installers create a user-local `ouroboros` command without sudo. You do not need Python or uv.

Ouroboros bundles [Claudexor](https://github.com/razzant/claudexor) as its local execution layer for delegated coding and hosted-agent review. Ouroboros owns the task, memory, review, and final integration, while Claudexor runs the selected connected coding harness and returns durable execution evidence. [Explore Claudexor](https://claudexor.ai/).

The technical report, [Ouroboros: A Self-Developing Frontier Coding Agent with Reviewed Core Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.08311), describes the reviewed core-evolution system, the 161-day Hope deployment, and the benchmark campaigns summarized below. [Paper page](https://ouroboros-agent.ai/paper/) · [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2608.08311)

The charts below are self-reported results on Terminal-Bench 2.1, OSWorld-Verified, and CL-Bench, measured against Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and Hermes — on the same model where a matched pair was run, and against the public leaderboard where it was not.

Ouroboros first booted on February 16, 2026. During the following 48 hours, the repository advanced from the v4.1 line to v6.2.0. The self-authored record preserved from that period counts 32 evolution cycles. That first generation ran in Google Colab through Telegram and remains preserved on the [`legacy-google-colab`](https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros/tree/legacy-google-colab) branch and its [original project page](https://ouroboros-agent.ai/archive/first-generation/); the current generation carries the same identity into a native desktop and headless runtime.

## What Ouroboros Can Do

- **Modify its implementation.** Its editable surface spans application code, architecture, prompts, tools, and dependencies, while reflection can also reshape its living self-understanding.
- **Evolve autonomously.** Evolution campaigns turn selected improvements into reviewed changes that remain part of its Git history.
- **Continue across restarts.** Identity, memory, dialogue, knowledge, reflections, and version history form one ongoing biography.
- **Think between requests.** Background consciousness supports reflection, initiative, and preparation outside the immediate request-response loop.
- **Coordinate a live swarm.** Specialist agents can investigate or act in parallel, share task-tree findings, and return work for integration.
- **Work on external projects.** A separate Git workspace can receive the full task loop while Ouroboros keeps its own repository and governance boundary distinct.
- **Operate through desktop or CLI.** The native app and gateway-backed command line expose the same managed tasks, progress, artifacts, logs, and schedules.
- **Organize long-running work.** Project rooms keep working folders, journals, knowledge, task history, and conversations connected to the same identity.
- **Use remote or local models.** Supported provider APIs and local GGUF models can fill the runtime's configurable cognitive roles.
- **Grow through reviewed extensions.** Skills, transport bridges, widgets, MCP tools, and companion processes expand capability without folding every integration into the core.
- **Keep self-change inspectable.** Git history, review evidence, explicit protected surfaces, and restart checks make implementation changes traceable.

This list is an orientation, not a second specification. [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md) defines Ouroboros's identity and constitutional boundaries; [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) are the current technical sources of truth.

## Benchmarks

Ouroboros has reproducible self-reported state-of-the-art results on Terminal-Bench 2.1, OSWorld-Verified, and CL-Bench. In those model-matched results, it leads Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and Hermes. The public SWE-bench Pro matched pair is a statistical tie with Codex CLI. A separate GAIA campaign reports 129/165 for Ouroboros and 131/165 for Claude Code, with strict pass@1 at 128/165 for both; its scrubbed trace capsule is still pending. Upstream review can take time, so open submissions are marked without delaying publication. Read every row as model plus harness because the same model can score differently inside a different harness.

## Advanced installation

Normal desktop users can stop after the download and quick-start instructions above. The options below are for detailed Linux setup, headless use, and development.

### Packaged Linux details

- **Debian / Ubuntu / Astra Linux x86_64:** [download the `.deb`][download-linux-deb-amd64] and run `sudo apt install ./ouroboros_*_amd64.deb`. It installs Git as a package dependency, installs Ouroboros to `/opt/ouroboros`, puts `ouroboros` on `PATH`, and adds a desktop entry plus an opt-in systemd user unit.
- **Fedora / RHEL x86_64:** [download the generic `.rpm`][download-linux-rpm-x86_64] and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.x86_64.rpm`. It uses the same layout, Git dependency, and opt-in user unit as the `.deb`.
- **RED OS 8 x86_64:** [download the `red80` package][download-linux-rpm-red80-x86_64] and run `sudo dnf install ./ouroboros-*.red80.x86_64.rpm`. CI also attempts non-blocking install-and-run smokes on Astra Linux 1.8 and RED OS 8; inspect the tagged workflow run for their outcome.
- **Other Linux x86_64:** use the [AppImage][download-linux-appimage-x86_64] or the extraction-friendly [tar.gz archive][download-linux-x86_64]. Git must already be installed.

The native `.deb` and `.rpm` never enable or start their user service. It is an alternative to launching from the desktop entry and controls only instances started through `systemctl --user`. See the [systemd user-service guide](packaging/systemd/README.md).

#### Install the Linux AppImage

User-level installation means copying the portable executable to a stable path and making it executable; it does not need root access. Ouroboros bootstrap still requires Git on the host:

```bash
VERSION=x.y.z
install -Dm755 "./Ouroboros-${VERSION}-linux-x86_64.AppImage" \
  "$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
```

The embedded desktop file and icon allow compatible AppImage integration tools to register that stable path with the application menu. The same file exposes the packaged CLI:

```bash
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage" --cli status
```

If FUSE mounting is unavailable, extract and run ephemerally instead:

```bash
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 "$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage"
```

Chromium and WebKit binaries are bundled, but their distro-level shared libraries remain host dependencies. If a browser engine reports missing libraries, use the native `.deb`/`.rpm` package where available, or extract the AppImage and let its bundled Playwright report/install the packages required by your distribution:

```bash
"$HOME/Applications/Ouroboros.AppImage" --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/usr/lib/ouroboros/_internal/python-standalone/bin/python3 \
  -m playwright install-deps chromium webkit
```

### Connected coding subscriptions

Use your existing **Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor subscriptions** for delegated coding and review. Ouroboros drives them through [Claudexor](https://github.com/razzant/claudexor), its bundled multi-harness engine. Connect accounts in **Settings → Agents**; no separate Claudexor install is needed. Release artifacts carry the exact reviewed engine and Node archives. Source checkouts obtain those same pinned archives on first use.

### Headless CLI with uv

For a user-level CLI/server install without cloning a working tree, uv can
build Ouroboros directly from the contribution branch:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros.git@ouroboros"
ouroboros --help
```

The tool environment is isolated and exposes the `ouroboros` and
`ouroboros-web` commands. Update or remove it with:

```bash
uv tool upgrade ouroboros
uv tool uninstall ouroboros
```

This Git-branch form follows the latest `ouroboros` commit and resolves the
dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`; `uv tool install` does not consume
the repository's `uv.lock`. Replacing `ouroboros` after the `@` with a reviewed
full commit SHA pins the Ouroboros source revision, but dependencies are still
resolved from `pyproject.toml`. Use the source setup below for a lock-verified
environment, development, repository tests, and the complete browser extras,
or use a platform release artifact for the packaged desktop runtime.

<a id="run-from-source"></a>

### Develop or run from source

Clone the repository only when you plan to contribute, modify Ouroboros, run repository tests, or need a lock-verified development checkout. Normal users should use the packaged downloads above.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- uv 0.12.1 (the exact resolver version pinned by this checkout)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/), optional unless you use GitHub integration

#### Setup

Install the pinned resolver version:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.12.1/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.12.1/install.ps1 | iex"
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razzant/ouroboros.git
cd ouroboros
uv sync --locked --extra browser --group dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --extra browser --group dev
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Run

```bash
ouroboros server
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` in your browser. The setup wizard will guide you through API key configuration.

#### Google Colab

Use [`notebooks/colab_quickstart.py`](notebooks/colab_quickstart.py) as a Colab-compatible cell script when you need a source-mode runtime without the desktop UI. It keeps runtime data on Google Drive and preserves the original Colab path without making it the primary installation flow.

#### CLI / Headless

The `ouroboros` command attaches to the local runtime by default and starts one when `--start` is passed. It exposes managed tasks, progress streams, artifacts, logs, schedules, settings, skills, and evolution controls without duplicating the server's business logic.

```bash
ouroboros status
ouroboros run --start "2+2?"
ouroboros run "Summarize current runtime state"
ouroboros run --workspace /path/to/project --memory-mode forked --patch-out result.patch "Fix the failing test"
ouroboros tasks list
ouroboros logs tail progress --task-id <task_id>
ouroboros schedule add --name nightly-review --cron "0 2 * * *" "Run a maintenance review"
ouroboros schedule list
```

External workspaces must be separate Git worktree roots and may not overlap Ouroboros's own repository or data directory. Patch, streaming, detached-task, and schedule semantics are documented in the CLI help and the canonical [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

#### For Agents

Another agent, script, or CI job can invoke Ouroboros through the same gateway-backed CLI:

```bash
ouroboros run --start \
  --workspace /path/to/project \
  --memory-mode forked \
  --patch-out result.patch \
  --result-json-out result.json \
  "Investigate the task, act, and verify the result"
```

Use `--jsonl` for a machine-readable event stream and `--detach` when the caller will follow the task with `ouroboros tasks watch <task_id>` or inspect it with `ouroboros tasks show <task_id>`. External workspace runs keep Ouroboros's own repository and governance context separate, then export changes as reviewable patch artifacts.

To change Ouroboros itself, follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): read [docs/CHECKLISTS.md](docs/CHECKLISTS.md) in full, and map [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md), [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), and [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) by their headings, reading every section relevant to your change in full before editing.

#### Configuration

The first-run wizard and **Settings** configure model access, cognitive roles, local models, review policy, runtime mode, budget, skills, and optional integrations. Ouroboros supports configurable remote providers, compatible endpoints, and local GGUF inference; exact settings and defaults live in [`ouroboros/config.py`](ouroboros/config.py) and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The server binds to `127.0.0.1:8765` by default. Read [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) before exposing it beyond loopback; non-local binds need `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` or an explicitly trusted external access layer.

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

`pyproject.toml` is the direct-dependency authority and `uv.lock` is the
cross-platform resolution lock. Release builds install the generated
`requirements-runtime.lock` compatibility export into embedded interpreters
that intentionally ship pip rather than uv. Build-only requirements are
exported ephemerally from `uv.lock` and are not committed. The tiny
`requirements.txt` file is only a pointer to that export for already-released
managed updaters; it is not a second dependency declaration. After changing
dependencies, refresh the reviewed lock and runtime export with:

```bash
uv lock
uv export --locked --no-dev --extra browser --no-emit-project --no-hashes --no-annotate --output-file requirements-runtime.lock
```

---

## Build

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ouroboros-web .
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 \
  -e OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD='choose-a-password' \
  -e OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT=/workspace \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  ouroboros-web
```

Docker runs the web runtime, not the native desktop shell. It bundles Chromium and WebKit support; use [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for network and container policy.

### Release tag prerequisite

Platform build scripts package only a commit already tagged with `v$(cat VERSION)`. Tag the exact release commit first:

```bash
git tag -a "v$(tr -d '[:space:]' < VERSION)" -m "Release v$(tr -d '[:space:]' < VERSION)"
```

`scripts/build_repo_bundle.py` verifies the tag and embeds the source binding into the packaged repository bundle. Signing, notarization, bytecode sealing, and CI invariants are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### macOS (.dmg)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
OUROBOROS_SIGN=0 bash build.sh
```

Output: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>.dmg`, containing `Ouroboros.app`, an `Applications` shortcut, and `Install CLI.command`. Omit `OUROBOROS_SIGN=0` when a Developer ID signing identity is configured.

### Linux (.AppImage and .tar.gz)

```bash
bash scripts/download_python_standalone.sh
bash build_linux.sh
```

Outputs: `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.AppImage` and the extraction-friendly `dist/Ouroboros-<VERSION>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`. The AppImage needs host Git; run it after `chmod +x`, or pass `--cli` to reach its bundled CLI. If FUSE is unavailable, set `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` when launching it. The tarball contains `./Ouroboros/bin/install-ouroboros-cli`. If bundled browser tools need host libraries, run `./Ouroboros/_internal/python-standalone/bin/python3 -m playwright install-deps chromium webkit` from the extracted tarball.

On a build host where system packages are managed separately, set `OUROBOROS_SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL_DEPS=1`; Chromium and WebKit are still downloaded and bundled, but the build does not invoke `sudo` to install host libraries.

### Linux (.deb and .rpm)

Wraps the payload `build_linux.sh` just produced, so run it afterwards:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dpkg-dev rpm   # rpm provides rpmbuild
bash scripts/build_linux_packages.sh
```

Output: `dist/ouroboros_<VERSION>_amd64.deb`, `dist/ouroboros-<VERSION>-1.x86_64.rpm` and `dist/ouroboros-<VERSION>-1.red80.x86_64.rpm` (RED OS 8). All three declare Git as a runtime dependency and install to `/opt/ouroboros` with a `/usr/bin/ouroboros` symlink, a desktop entry, and an opt-in systemd user unit. The Linux launcher is built by the bundled portable Python so the build runner cannot raise its glibc floor. `bash scripts/smoke_linux_packages.sh official <deb> <rpm> <red80-rpm>` installs all three through `apt` or `dnf` in Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 42 containers, resolves Git, verifies the installed unit, and checks both the real CLI and a bounded desktop-launcher start; this lane gates the release. Swap `official` for `vendor` to repeat the check on Astra Linux 1.8 and RED OS 8 images from the vendors' own registries — that lane runs informationally in CI, so an outage at a third-party registry cannot block a tagged release.

## Architecture and Runtime Data

The native launcher starts a web runtime and supervisor-managed agent workers. The agent core lives in `ouroboros/`, the interface in `web/`, the process plane in `supervisor/`, and the runtime's durable identity, state, history, logs, and skills under `~/Ouroboros/data/`.

The full component map, data flow, API surface, storage layout, safety boundary, and operational rationale live in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Deployment details live in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Runtime Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/panic` | Stop the runtime and its managed processes immediately. |
| `/restart` | Restart without automatically resuming the active owner task. |
| `/status` | Show workers, task queue, and budget state. |
| `/evolve on\|off` | Start or stop autonomous evolution. |
| `/review` | Queue a deep constitutional and architectural self-review. |
| `/bg start\|stop\|status` | Control background consciousness. |


## Philosophy

The 13 Constitution principles — Agency, Continuity, Meta-over-Patch,
Immune Integrity, Self-Creation, LLM-First, Authenticity & Reality
Discipline, Minimalism, Becoming, Versioning and Releases, the absorbed
Iterations / Spiral lineage, and Epistemic Stability — are defined in
full in [`BIBLE.md`](BIBLE.md). That file is the constitutional SSOT
(Bible P4 Ship-of-Theseus protection) and this README intentionally does
not paraphrase it.

## Version History

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 6.119.11 | 2026-09-22 | **refactor: tool-arg streak + reclaim provenance extracted from loop_tool_execution (crd-0008 GIANT_PATHS closure).** The 1688-line donor (`ouroboros/loop_tool_execution.py`) sat above the 1600-line gate since 6.119.8 (readiness warning `crd-0008`, reopened at every gate since); this release closes it with two cohesive leaves: `ouroboros/tools/tool_arg_streak.py` (task-scoped consecutive arg-error counter: lazy init on the tool ctx, increment ONLY on typed arg_error, reset ONLY on a non-error outcome — timeouts neutral — plus the alert line riding the periodic self-check; 78 lines) and `ouroboros/tools/reclaim_bridge.py` (per-task reclaim provenance accessors: trace refs, negative memo, post-reclaim prune; 42 lines). The donor keeps ONE one-release re-export plane so `loop.py`'s import surface stays byte-identical (ratchet BYTE_DEBT stays 284743 — not a byte worse); consumers moved to real homes (`loop.py` lazy import at 2048, both test suites). Donor end state: 1598 lines <1600, ratchet clean on the donor (the only remaining ratchet error is the pre-existing crd-0009 BYTE_DEBT exact-match debt — unchanged by this diff). Verification: py_compile of all touched files; 71+ tests green (test_tool_args_recovery 12 + test_context_reclaim_trace 4 + test_loop_misc consumer suite + test_repo_health_smoke ratchet pin). Carriers via bump_release_version in one call. Roll-off this release: 6.119.6 (cap-oldest patch row; six patch rows exceeded the P9 cap of five after this row was added — cap-driven; body at git tag v6.119.6, added to the older-releases enumeration). |
| 6.119.10 | 2026-09-22 | **fix: the 6.119.9 docstring restore completed for real — the duplicate fragment the 6.119.9 commit wave caught is gone; the false byte-exact claim in the 6.119.9 row is corrected in place.** The 6.119.9 in-task cleanup cut the tool-call garbage (lines with '<tool_call>' fragments) but left a duplicated '3) Typed arg noise status for the parse-refusal path.' line — the cut's assert verified garbage-removal, not duplicate-removal, so the wrong predicate passed. The paid wave flagged it unanimously (4 reviewers: 3x changelog_accuracy + self_consistency + scope cross_surface_consistency). Fixed: positional cut with the dup-left/noise-left/single-3-4 asserts (suite now 303 lines, py_compile OK); README 6.119.9 claim corrected honestly rather than silently; carriers 9/9 synced to 6.119.10 via bump_release_version in one call. Roll-off this release: 6.119.5 (cap-oldest patch row; six patch rows exceeded the P9 cap of five after this row was added — cap-driven; body at git tag v6.119.5, added to the older-releases enumeration). |
| 6.119.9 | 2026-09-22 | **docs: the 6.119.8 triad advisory wave applied — five advisories closed, one live N=1 closed the class inside its own fix task.** (1) README 6.119.8 row counter 13→12 tests (grep-verified; the numeric-drift class that 6.119.4 closed, back for a fourth time). (2) Streak-reset semantics stated honestly everywhere: the counter increments ONLY on typed arg_error and resets ONLY on a non-error outcome — a REAL timeout (is_error=True, status=timeout) is neutral, neither increment nor reset; the process comment, the module docstring, and the timeout test were corrected from the old "resets on any non-arg-error outcome" wording, and the test now pins the timeout with is_error=True (streak stays 1) — the old test modeled is_error=False, which reset the counter and proved nothing about the actual path. (3) Typed arg_error registered in `_outcome_tool_errors.py` so the ⚠️ TOOL_ARG_ERROR family is no longer dropped by the documented SSOT trace classifier. (4) `process_tool_results` guards a non-dict `result_meta` before the streak update. (5) `arg_recovery` returns a VALID doc with honest kind "parsed" (was misnamed "empty_args" — nothing had been repaired). Plus: the suite docstring corrupted by a degraded edit inside this very task was cleaned in-task, but the first pass left a duplicate "3)" fragment that the commit wave caught live (four reviewers, one verdict) — fully removed in 6.119.10; the 6.119.8 substrate fix caught its own class live, in the task that shipped it, twice. Carriers 9/9 synced to 6.119.9 via bump_release_version in-task. Roll-off this release: 6.119.4 (cap-oldest patch row; six patch rows exceeded the P9 cap of five after this row was added — cap-driven; body at git tag v6.119.4, added to the older-releases enumeration). |
| 6.119.8 | 2026-09-22 | **feat: substrate fix for mid-arc tool-args degradation — bounded wire repair + accepted-params ladder + task-scoped degradation alert (owner's substrate-директива, structural slice).** Three measured incidents on one class (bc50794b burned ~15 consecutive rounds of degraded tool-args mid-arc; 74c83c57 zero-call manifest final; live plan_task faceplants in this very release arc — one spec JSON died on an embedded newline mid-string) each failed at an honest typed refusal, but the error carried NOTHING repairable: parse refusals never reached registry validation, so unlike registry schema rejections they carried no accepted-params fact, and consecutive tool-arg failures were counted nowhere. Three structural changes, zero prompt edits, zero new gates: (1) `ouroboros/tools/arg_recovery.py` — bounded, deterministic, content-aware WIRE-FORMAT repairs at the parse seam in `_execute_single_tool` (R1 empty/null→{}, R2 structural truncation repair: end-cut on a clean tail, else last-boundary-cut with container closing; bounded 20KiB scan); a repaired call proceeds ONLY on a clean single-candidate reparse to a dict — lists/strings no-parse refuse — and repaired args still pass FULL registry validation and the safety layer (the repair re-shapes the wire format, never the authorization); refusal text stays fully honest with an added "repair refused" clause, and the typed `arg_wire_repaired` fact rides `result_meta` (never the tool result text). (2) Parse refusals now carry the accepted-params ladder line `(accepted parameters: …)` sourced ONLY from the registry's public SSOT accessor `get_schema_by_name` (fail-soft: unknown/disabled/alias → no line), so the model can re-derive arguments from the error text alone without a read round-trip. (3) First-line prefix pin: `⚠️ TOOL_ARG_ERROR` maps to the typed status `arg_error` (previously collapsed into generic `error`); `process_tool_results` maintains a task-scoped consecutive arg-error streak on the tool context (increments ONLY on typed arg_error outcomes; resets on success — honest recovery credit; task boundaries reset by construction), and at ≥3 the NEXT periodic self-check injection prepends a degradation alert (count, unique tool names bounded to last 5 in first-seen order, the re-derive-from-error-text instruction) riding ONLY the existing cache-breaking self-check user turn — below threshold the checkpoint text stays byte-identical to today. Regression suite `tests/test_tool_args_recovery.py` (12 tests) pins repair rules, refusal honesty, ladder fail-softness, dispatch-after-repair with typed fact, streak semantics, and the self-check ride; seam suites green (final-text integrity 24, gateway parity + contracts + packaging/release). Roll-off this release: 6.119.3 (cap-oldest patch row; six patch rows exceeded the P9 cap of five after this row was added — cap-driven; body at git tag v6.119.3, added to the older-releases enumeration). |
| 6.119.7 | 2026-09-22 | **fix: the 6.119.6 frame-strip was dead code on a false premise — removed; the clear contract completed on both owned surfaces.** The paid triad wave of 6.119.6 caught the diff carrying a real change built on a false premise: the claim "the 6.119.5 stamp rewrites text today" was contradicted by the 6.119.5 code (the probe only stores a `frame` key inside the usage facts; the seam never modifies the answer) and by the 6.119.5 changelog row itself ("DELIVERY NEVER MUTATES AN ANSWER"). Removed in this release: the dead `_prior_stamp_frames` recognizer, its derived regex, and the frame-strip loop in `prepare_terminal_send_event` — the frame never appears in the surviving text by construction, and `text` is a str parameter, so a local rebind never mutated anything. Its salvage-read test was confounded (passing under both "strip works" and "frame never in text") and is deleted as undetermined evidence. Completed the real remaining gap from the same finding: a CLEAN re-finalize over a prior degenerate stamp now also clears the stale `progress_meta["final_text_integrity"]` frame in the re-derive branch (the seam owns both surfaces — usage fact and progress_meta stamp — every finalize clears each inherited surface it cannot restate); previously the clear ran only in the not-applicable branch, so a reused EVENT could deliver the previous answer's frame on a later clean/short final. Text is never touched on any path. Pinned by the rewritten TestPriorStampCleanup (5 tests: short-final clears both surfaces with byte-exact delivered text, empty-final clears the fact, clean re-finalize clears the stale frame and restates honest facts, delivered text is byte-identical over a degenerate rescan, salvage path restates clean facts and keeps the preserved copy byte-exact); seam suites green (integrity 24, lane 11; gateway parity, contracts, packaging/release sync 115 — green). Carriers 9/9 via bump_release_version. Roll-off this release: 6.119.2 (cap-oldest patch row, six patch rows exceeded the P9 limit of five after this row was added — cap-driven; body at git tag v6.119.2, added to the older-releases enumeration). |
| 6.118.0 | 2026-09-16 | **feat: advisory touched-pack compact inline policy — the advisory-oversize class closed.** The advisory critic's touched-file pack inlined the full content of every changed file up to 1 MB each; a release diff carrying `uv.lock` (730 KB) inflated the advisory prompt to 2,176,227 chars measured on a 19-file release-set replay (incidents: 2,234,246 > 1.6M ceiling, 1,645,402 snapshot, native-episode transcript bound 934,787 > 900,000) — forcing loud `skip_advisory_review` on every lockfile-bearing release since 6.116.1. The advisory call-site now builds its pack with `inline_policy='compact'` (new `build_touched_file_pack` parameter): lockfile basenames (`_LOCKFILE_NAMES`: uv.lock, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, poetry.lock, Pipfile.lock, Cargo.lock, Gemfile.lock, composer.lock, packages.lock.json, bun.lockb — matched lowercased, any size) and any file ≥ 131,072 bytes render a visible metadata row `*(omitted — {reason}; {size:,} bytes)*` instead of content — no silent truncation; everything else inlines as before. Default `inline_policy='full'` keeps every non-advisory caller byte-identical (managed subject, triad, scope). Policy lives in the leaf `ouroboros/tools/advisory_pack_policy.py` (extraction kept `review_helpers.py` at the 1600-line ratchet edge); fail-closed machinery unchanged: 500K diff gate, 1.6M emergency ceiling, typed `_predispatch_size_skip` skips, and the 900,000-char native-episode transcript bound all stay. Measured on the 19-file release-set replay (real bytes from HEAD): 2,176,227 chars under the full policy → 444,887 under compact (< 900K episode bound, ~2× headroom, ~4.9× smaller than the full pack); the unit fixture in `tests/test_review_helpers_pack_limits.py` is a separate synthetic release-shaped set pinning the boundary behavior. Advisory + managed/advisory/readiness suites green; two triad-lane test failures verified pre-existing on clean 6.117.1 via A/B on a /tmp HEAD copy (not this diff). Lockfile versions remain deterministically checked by `check_worktree_version_sync`/`sync_release_metadata`, so no review information is lost. |
| 6.117.0 | 2026-09-15 | **feat: per-phase preflight budgets — the commit gate now fits its own suite (ibl-preflight-phase-budgets).** The one shared 900s budget could never fit the parallel `not serial` pass on the 2-core reference class of installs: the pass was killed at 888s/900s (55% complete, zero red tests) and the serial pass never started, forcing manual handoffs on 3 of the last 5 releases. The resolved total (default 2700s; `OUROBOROS_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_SEC` override semantics unchanged) is now carved into phase ceilings — node ≤ 5% capped at 120s, parallel 80% of the remainder, serial the exact unrounded remainder (`_preflight_phase_budgets`) — slices are ceilings, unused time flows back through the remainder rule, and the whole gate stays bounded by the single resolved total. A phase expiry reports its own slice and the total, so the next kill is self-explaining. `tests/test_chat_upload.py::test_upload_size_limit` moves to the serial lane per the sanctioned crash-a-worker criterion (PARALLEL_WORKER_CRASH, gw1, 2026-09-13 gate run); the serial-lane collect surface verified 1/16; the seven streaming tests in `tests/test_web_search.py` join the serial lane under the same sanctioned criterion (gw1 crash on `test_streaming_direct_openai_cost_remains_nullable`, 2026-09-15 gate run), and `_grow_ledger` in `tests/test_context.py` moved to chunked allocation after its single 20 MB allocation OOM-crashed a worker (gw1, same run). A budget-split unit suite plus orchestration and expiry-diagnosis pins replace the old total-budget pin. |
| 6.115.0 | 2026-09-06 | **feat: class-aware ARCHITECTURE.md context residency (owner decision).** In owner-Max the full operational map stays resident only for self-body classes (default-lane pooled tasks, evolution, self-body work); direct-chat turns and externally-bound work (external workspaces, project trees, subagents, API/CLI/scheduled surfaces) receive the existing lossless H2-H4 navigation map plus a visible on-demand pointer — a relocation, never truncation. Low mode unchanged; all review flows unchanged; DEVELOPMENT.md's own classifier unchanged; explicit `context_requires_self_body_docs` overrides in both directions; consciousness keeps full-in-max via the default. BIBLE.md P1 amended by one phrase (class residency of self-body docs = owner-selected posture; nav map + pointer = lossless representation). DEVELOPMENT.md context matrix and ARCHITECTURE.md §6 + §1 tree entry synced in the same commit; doc tests pin the class-dependent matrix (~105K resident tokens saved per call for never-opens-the-map classes). |
